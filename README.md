# collections-cleaners

This is a collection of scripts in use by the collections team to clean up the
collections at the Internet Archive. They require administration privileges and 
the use of the InternetArchive Python interface script. 

These scripts are being published on github to allow commentary and learning materials
for the internal maintenance of the Archive's stores of materials.
